# Homework_3
This is gonna be for homework 3. Go ahead and pull whatever and we'll bring it up with each other.

if we wanna add anyone, lemme know who they are and their github username and i'll put them in :D


if you change something, it would be great if we keep a copy of the old one, so just like comment it out. if you dont do this, i'll take you off the collaborator's list and you'll have to start doing it via pull request.
